#Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming — Book Summary


> Six blind sages were shown an elephant and met to discuss their experience.
> “It’s wonderful,” said the first, “an elephant is like a rope: slender and flexible.
> ” “No, no, not at all,” said the second, “an elephant is like a tree: sturdily planted on the ground.”
> “Marvelous,” said the third, “an elephant is like a wall.”
> “Incredible,” said the fourth, “an elephant is a tube filled with water.”
> “What a strange piecemeal beast this is,” said the fifth.
> “Strange indeed,” said the sixth, “but there must be some underlying harmony. Let us investigate the matter further.”
> – Freely adapted from a traditional Indian fable

> A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking.
