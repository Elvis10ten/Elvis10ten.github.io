I will show you how to use this app on your java or Symbian phone to create an app.

First, download the J2ME SDK MOBILE from www.mumey.wen.ru. Open the app and click on **New Project**. Enter `HelloWorld` as the **Project Name** and select a directory to save the project files by clicking on browse.

Click Create and allow access until you see **Source Packages** and **Resources**. Open **Source Packages**, press **Options**(left soft key), go down and select **Project Properties**.

Select **Build**, select **Creating JAR**. Change JAD file Name from `HelloWorld.jad` to `HelloWorld_jad` and JAR file Name from `HelloWorld.jar` to `HelloWorld_jar`.

Go back and press **Ok** again and allow access.

You would be taken back to **Source Packages**, press **Options**(left soft key) again. Select **New**. Select **MIDlet** as the File Type, click **Next**. Change MIDlet Name to `HelloWorld` and Class Name to `HelloWorld` (they don't have to be the same), leave MIDlet Icon empty for now then click finish and allow access.

You will be taken to a white background with codes (the editor screen).

Clear every line of code by pressing 5. Copy the codes below into the editor.

```java:title=HelloWorld.java
import javax.microedition.midlet.*;
import javax.microedition.lcdui.*;

public class HelloWorld extends MIDlet {

  public void startApp() {
    Form f = new Form("My first app");
    f.append("Hello World");
    Display.getDisplay(this).setCurrent(f);
  }

  public void pauseApp() {
  }

  public void destroyApp(boolean unconditional) {
  }
}
```
 
Click **Save**(OK), which takes you back to the editor. Press **Menu**(right soft key) and click on **Build**(it has a hammer icon), allow access until the app closes. Open the app again for compiling, allow access until it closes. Open the app again for pre-verifying, allow access as usual until it closes. Open the app the last time for jar-ing, it probably gives you an error like this:

> pre-jar: do-jar: JARing:java.io.IOException: Failed to write to file BUILD FAILED.

When you get that message or even if you don't, exit the app and open blueFTP (if you don't have one, search for it on www.skenpomobile.net and download). Go to the Project Folder with blueFTP, go to the build folder, copy `manifest.mf` and go to preverified folder and create a new folder there named `META-INF`, and paste the `manifest.mf` file into the new folder. Go back to the preverified folder and mark `HelloWorld.class` and `META-INF`, press **Menu**(left soft key), and select **Compress items(jar)**. Change JAR name to `HelloWorld_jar` then press OK and allow access until you get compression completed successfully.

Exit BlueFTP and go to the preverifed folder without any app and rename the file from `HelloWorld_jar` to `HelloWorld.jar`. Open the **HelloWorld** app and you will get a Hello World Message.

Bravo, you just built your first app with J2ME SDK MOBILE.
