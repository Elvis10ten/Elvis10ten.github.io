Two weeks ago, I embarked on an audacious cycling adventure — cycling alone from Berlin to Prague (~360km). Prior to the trip, I had only done ~70km max (with company).

It was a fantabuluous adventure: I improved my physical and mental strength; Interacted with the beautiful people, geography & cultures enroute; and I feel great overall ([natural high](https://dictionary.apa.org/natural-high)).

Having tasted the sweetness of long distance cycling, my eyes are set on Amsterdam, Copenhagen, or a town in Poland next.

In this post, I will share how I planned for the trip and how it went.

## 📜 1. The plan
I made a 3-day plan that spanned across 3 distinct cities:
   * Berlin 🇩🇪 → Cottbus 🇩🇪
   * Cottbus 🇩🇪 → Dresden 🇩🇪
   * Dresden 🇩🇪 → Prague 🇨🇿

![Original plan on a whiteboard](assets/plan_whiteboard.jpg)

I spent hours studying the terrain and modifying the route on a satelite map (Komoot/GMaps satelite view). My goal was to always be within a few kilometers of some human settlement — incase of an emergency.

#### 🚴‍♂️ Cycling gear
Up to this point, I had mostly cycled casually: In normal clothes, in a normal bike.

This wasn't gonna fly for an international trip because of safety, performance, and various other concerns. I bought the [Bergamont Grandurance 4](https://www.bergamont.com/at/de/product/bergamont-grandurance-4) and a few other "serious" cycling gear.

#### 🛡 Tactical gear
I have heard the stories about east germany. While I will try my best to avoid any conflict, I prepared for the worst — because the fact that you don't want a fight, doesn't mean a fight doesn't want you. I won't go into the details of my self-defense gear — but in summary, I was prepared for serious aggression from a group of 5-6 people.

Security is multi-facet: I planned the routes with safety in mind, picked the right clothes at the right time, etc. Also, one of my phones was constantly beaming my location and capturing other sensor data (including audio) to the cloud. I asked my closed friends to periodically check in on these.

Honestly, having lived in rough neighbourhoods, I was more scared of having to deal with some wild animal than some human. However, people told me my fear was irrational as Germany doesn't have that many animals that can kill you.

#### 🥗 Supplies
* **Water**: I had a capacity for 2.5L.
* **Food**: I packed protein bars, nuts, bread, plantain chips, banana, apple, and a peach. This was hard as I'm used to eating fresh home cooked meals.
  ![Food](assets/foods.jpg)
* **Tools**: I had two backup phones, two power banks, inner tube, adhesive patch, mini pump, and a few other cycling tools.

I frequently stopped at grocery stores to refill both the water and food supplies.

## ⚙️ 2. The execution
It was gonna be a 3-day trip with a stop in each city in the plan above.

#### 🌳 Day-1 (The road to ~~Cottbus~~ Luckau)
I started very late (around 2pm), so I had to scrap the plan of going to Cottbus. Postponing the start to the next day would have interfered with my weekend plans for Prague, so I decided to go to Luckau which is a small city in Brandenburg.

I had to cycle late at night. For safety reasons I stopped stopping to take photos or use the camera as it got darker. There were lots of beautiful sights that I didn't capture. The windmills with the sunset as its background was fantabulous to see.

#### 🏰 Day-2 (The road to Dresden)
I slept in a stranger's place at the end of day-1. She also made breakfast for me — talk about random acts of kindness from a German.

Day-2 was about getting to Dresden ASAP so I can cycle around the city during the day. I wanted to be focused in the moment and get to Dresden fast which meant I took less photos overall.

#### 🏔 Day-3 (The road to Prague)
I was so focused on getting to Prague early in day-3 that most things were a blur. Some of the photos are included in the photo dump below.

## 🍾 3. Party in prague
Prague was incredibly fun. I arrived on Saturday and met with my friend. We spent the day doing the usual boring touristy stuff like taking pictures. We spent the (saturday and sunday) night clubbing.

The city was beautiful and I wished I could have spent more time there. I should be back again.
